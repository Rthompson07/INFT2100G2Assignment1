<?php
/*
-------------------------------------
File: constants.php
-------------------------------------
Purpose:
- To store constant values that will be frequently used across the application.
- This file should contain values such as the database connection details (host, username, password, database name).
- By keeping them as constants, it ensures that these values remain unchanged throughout the application and can be
- easily managed from a single location.

To-Do:
1. Define constants for the database connection (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME).
2. If there are other application-wide constants, like API keys or directory paths, define them here.

Methods/Components to incorporate:
- `const`: This is used to set a constant with a name and value.

Note:
- Be extremely careful about not sharing or exposing sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
- If you use version control, consider using environment variables or other methods to keep sensitive details out
- of the codebase.

Remember to:
- Avoid redefining constants. Once a constant is set, it cannot be changed or undefined.
- Use uppercase letters for constant names for clarity and convention.
